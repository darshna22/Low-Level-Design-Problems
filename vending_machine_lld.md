* The machine should keep track of the available products and their quantities.
* The machine should handle multiple transactions concurrently and ensure data consistency.
* The machine should provide an interface for restocking products and collecting money.
* The machine should handle exceptional scenarios, such as insufficient funds or out-of-stock products.
